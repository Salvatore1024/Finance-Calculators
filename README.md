**PROGRAM NAME**:<br>
Finance Calculators

**DESCRIPTION**:<br>
For this project I created a program that simulates two financial calculators, one to calculate the interest 
generated as a result of an investment and another that calculates the installment to be repaid following a 
loan of money for the purchase of a house. Click on the project name to see the full code of the program.

**USAGE**:<br>
Run the python file and follow the instructions on the terminal.

This program was created during the DfE Skills Bootcamp provided by HyperionDev.
