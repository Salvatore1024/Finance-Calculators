***PROGRAM NAME***:
Finance Calculators

***DESCRIPTION***:
For this project I created a program that simulates two financial calculators, one to calculate the interest 
generated as a result of an investment and another that calculates the installment to be repaid following a 
loan of money for the purchase of a house. Click on the project name to see the full code of the program.

***USAGE***:
Run the python file and follow the instructions on the terminal.

This program was created for DfE Skills Bootcamp, HyperionDev.
